# Some of my projects

This repository contains a collection of some data science projects I have developed. They have been mostly extracted
from books I have read or are just hobby projects I have been doing in my free time. They vary from data scraping up
to machine learning and data visualization:
  - [AB Tester](https://github.com/disanman/ab_tester) [WIP]: An python interface with some utilities for evaluating AB Tests.
  - Older projects:
      - [Deep Q-Learning applied to the Snake game](Snake_Deep_Q_Learning/Snake.ipynb): The snake game implemented in Python (using text) and using Deep Q-learning
      - [Financial data scraping and analysis](Finviz_Spider/Finviz.ipynb): A crawler/spider for getting financial data out of Finviz
      - [Stepwise regression on Boston dataset](Boston_house_prices/Boston_house_prices.ipynb): Some regression analysis done on the Boston dataset
      - [California house prices regression](California_House_prices/California_House_prices.md): Some regressions analysis done in the California house prices dataset
      - [Fashion MNIST classification](Fashion_MNIST/Fashion_MNIST_Exploration_and_classification.ipynb): Some exploration and classification of images in the fashion industry.
